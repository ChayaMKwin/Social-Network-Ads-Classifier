# Social Network Ads Classifier

The Social Network Ads Classifier is a machine learning project encapsulated in a Jupyter Notebook, designed to predict whether an individual will purchase a product based on their social network advertising data. This project utilizes various classification algorithms to analyze the effectiveness of ads on a social networking site, thereby assisting businesses in targeting their advertisements more efficiently.

## Project Overview

This project aims to leverage user data from social networks, including age, estimated salary, and user engagement metrics, to predict purchasing behavior. By applying machine learning techniques, we can identify patterns and correlations between user characteristics and their likelihood to respond positively to an advertisement.

### Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleansing and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing the dataset to uncover insights and trends that influence purchasing decisions.
- **Model Selection:** Evaluating various classification models to find the most effective predictor. Models tested include Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation:** Utilizing confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC curve to assess the performance of the selected model.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model parameters to enhance prediction accuracy.
